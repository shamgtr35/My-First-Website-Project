<h2 style="font-size:30px;">Why Choose Code Nation?</h2>
<p><b>
<p>After carefully planing my coding school, I chose code nation. This is because I saw that code nation has the 
the platform to teach and train me to become a good coder. The course is very well constructed. The course has given
me a great foundation to develop a texted based horror game, which I found really challenging. Moving on from the game
I learnt how to design and make a website usng Html and CSS. Code Nation has a professional and friendly teaching
instructors that are very knowledgeable and always there to help, upon when needed. In the future, I am more than happy to
to study further using code nation and Highly recommend those who want to become coder, should come to Code Nation.</b></p>

<!-- <h4>Interest In Technology</h4> -->
<h4 style="font-size:30px;">Interest In Technology</h4>
<p><b>I am intrested in coding because I am facinated about the techology around us that uses coding. The future, in automotive will 
be using advanced coding. When vehicles become autonomous, using artificial intelligence it will include coding. Vehicles using self-drive 
systems will use coding and other function inside a vehicle will use coding. Automotive technology cosnsists of advanced engine systems which
allows code for sensors as part of the engine, electrical systems and mechanical systems cosist of coding too. </b></p>
